# VLookup

Takes two csv files, a primary and a lookup. Select a column in the primary to lookup in the lookup file. Choose a column to add from the lookup to the output. Outputs the primary and the column to a secondary. The output can be a new file or primary file.

## TODO
* [ ] Allow for multiple files to be added from the lookup
* [ ] Create a command line interface (currently you have to edit the index.js file to configure)
* [ ] Create a GUI using electron
